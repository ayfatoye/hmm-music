trying to find the right words to say
get some pull on your heartstrings and play
and I pray that these scary thoughts fade away
feeling jaded, then I take a -
(look in your eyes)

and I feel like I can fly
feel like I can’t die
I'll stay as long as you’ll let me
yeah, I’m here for the ride
cause no matter the weather, nor high the tide
wear my heart on my sleeve, feelings I won’t hide

cause you make it so easy, I can be me
my heart's pounding, it's like the shit I see on TV
thoughts running round place
got me feeling a certain type of way

(look in your eyes)
and I see blue sky, lavender roses, it's make believe, just you and I
won't even hold you, been hard to find my composure
your body sweeter than ambrosia, hella rare to come by

yet here you are, looking back at me 
don't even have to be, a different kind of me
i hit the jackpot, endless currency,
luckliest dude alive, when you're next to me
best of me, no one better, make them rest in peace
'cuse me please, magnum opus, you're a masterpiece 
on my knees, pray to God I don't lose the keys 
to your heart, tryna stay, won't break the lease

please.
i’m scared of ever missing 
self evanescing the miss that’s right here and is here to listen
i hopped in the pool, a beginner swimmer
back stroke, truth told, man i know i shouldn’t have her
even guarded my heart and tried to lay low
but you made your own keys, and showed me what for
lord knows,
that the thoughts been tryin to take hold
but you’ve shown me so much love, I cannot let go
let’s go

and there you are, and here i am
we’re on this road, we don’t know where it leads
but i’ve got you, and you’ve got me
so be my passenger, baby please

and there you are, and here i am
we’re on this road, we don’t know where it leads
but i’ve got you, and you’ve got me
let me be your passenger, baby please.
